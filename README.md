# YoutubeScoreFollowing

This repository contains the code for the ISMIR 2020 paper "Improved Handling of Repeats and Jumps in Audio-Sheet Image Synchronization."

The goal of this project is to automatically generate a piano score following video given an audio recording and its corresponding raw sheet music images.  Our main contribution is a novel alignment algorithm called Hierarchical DTW that can handle jumps and repeats even when jump locations are not known.
